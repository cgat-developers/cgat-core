CGAT-core is a workflow management system that allows users to quickly and reproducibly build scalable
data analysis pipelines. CGAT-core is  a set of libraries and helper functions used to enable researchers
to design and build computational workflows for the analysis of large-scale data-analysis.

Used in combination with `CGAT-apps <https://github.com/cgat-developers/cgat-apps>`_, we have deomonstrated the functionality of our
flexible workflow management system using a simple RNA-seq pipeline in `cgat-showcase <https://github.com/cgat-developers/cgat-showcase>`_.

CGAT-core is open-sourced, powerful and user-friendly, and has been continually developed
as a Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) workflow management system over the past 10 years.

For more advanced examples of cgatcore utilities please refer to our `cgat-flow <https://github.com/cgat-developers/cgat-flow>`_ repository, however
please be aware that this is in constant development and has many software dependancies.

Examples
--------

**cgat-showcase**
   This is a toy example of how to develop a simple workflow. Please refer to the `github page <https://github.com/cgat-developers/cgat-showcase>`_ and the `documentation <https://cgat-showcase.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_.
**cgat-flow**
   As an example of the flexibility and functionality of CGAT-core, we have developed a set of fully tested production pipelines for automating the analysis of our NGS data. Please refer to the `github <https://github.com/cgat-developers/cgat-flow>`_ page for information on how to install and use our code.
**Single cell RNA-seq**
   The cribbs lab use CGAT-core to develop pseudoalignment pipelines for single cell `dropseq methods <https://github.com/Acribbs/single-cell>`_ 
   The sansom lab use the CGAT-core workflow engine to develop single cell `sequencing analysis workflows <https://github.com/sansomlab/tenx>`_.
